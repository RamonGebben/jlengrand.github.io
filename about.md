I am **Julien Lengrand-Lambert**, a french 26 year old guy living in **Utrecht, the Netherlands**. I live there for 2 years with my girlfriend and my cat.

<br>

I work at [Spacemetric](http://www.spacemetric.se) during the day as a **Java developer** and **SCRUM master**. During my free time, you can find me **[coding](https://github.com/jlengrand)**, **[organizing meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Saturday-Morning-Coding-Utrecht/)** and **bouldering**. I also **[play DOTA2](http://dotabuff.com/teams/1132289) in a team**, and take **[a lot of pictures](http://www.fluidr.com/photos/49365498@N03/sets)** of things around me :).

<br>

Lately, I have [won a Startup Week-end](http://www.lengrand.fr/2012/12/how-we-won-our-first-startup-weekend/) with people I had just met, and spend a lot of time working on **[Brestram](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.lengrand.brestram&hl=en)**.
I try to write blog posts regularly, and be active on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/jlengrand)** as well; but I must admit that I usually prefer fixing bugs!
